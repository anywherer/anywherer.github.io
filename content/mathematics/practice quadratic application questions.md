Chairs have two prices. One type is $30 more expensive than the other. You can buy 10 more of the cheaper ones than the expensive ones for $1800. Find the cost of each type of chair.

Let the less expensive chair cost $x$ dollars.
The number of cheap chairs you can buy with 1800 dollars is $\dfrac{1800}{x}$.

$1800=(\dfrac{1800}{x}-10)\cdot (x+30)$

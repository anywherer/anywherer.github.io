The figure is a gym.

The perimeter is 400 m and encloses an area of $A$ $m^2$.

### 1a

Show that the area enclosed by the track is given by $A=400r-\pi r^2$

We know that $A=2xr+\pi r^2$

The perimeter is $2x+2\pi r=400$ 
so $x+\pi r=200$
so $x=200-\pi r$

$A=(400-2\pi r)+\pi r^2$
$A=400r-\pi r^2$

### 1b

We want the area enclosed to be as large as possible. Use differentiation to determine an exact value of $r$ for which $A$ is maximum.

$\dfrac{dA}{dr}=400-2\pi r$
$r=\dfrac{200}{\pi}$

### 1c

Show that the value of $r$ in part b gives the maximum value, by comparing the sign of $\dfrac{dA}{dr}$ of the values around it.

Less and the slope is positive, and more the slope is negative.

### 1d

Show that the maximum area is $\dfrac{40000}{\pi}m^2$
$A(\dfrac{200}{\pi})=\dfrac{40000}{\pi}$
